# Problem 1

Cleaned data to focus on the “Overall Health” topic"

``` r
overallhealth_brfss_smart2010 = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  subset(., topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  select(., -class, -topic, -question, -sample_size, -(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>% 
  mutate(response = as.factor(response))
```

``` r
healthdata2002 = overallhealth_brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  spread(response, data_value) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  mutate(freq = n()) %>% 
  filter(freq == 7)
```

In 2002, CT, FL, NC were observed at 7 locations.
